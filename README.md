Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.6+ installed.

MySQL Server (or a compatible alternative like MariaDB) installed and running.

pip for Python package installation.

2. Database Setup
Log in to MySQL as a user with administrative privileges (e.g., root).

mysql -u root -p

Create and use the database by running the following commands in the MySQL prompt.

CREATE DATABASE laundry_db;
USE laundry_db;

Create the necessary tables by copying the entire content of the database.sql file and pasting it into the MySQL prompt.

3. Backend Setup
Clone the Repository (or download the source code).

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment in the project's root directory.

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

Install the Required Dependencies from the requirements.txt file.

pip install -r requirements.txt

Configure Your Database Connection by opening app.py and updating the MYSQL_USER and MYSQL_PASSWORD with your own credentials.

# Inside app.py
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'your_mysql_username_here'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = 'your_mysql_password_here'

4. Running the Application
With your virtual environment still active, run the Flask application from the project's root directory.

python app.py

The server will start, typically on http://127.0.0.1:5000.
